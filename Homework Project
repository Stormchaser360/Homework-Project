    <p class="p1">Basketball was invented in 1891 by James Naismith, a Canadian physical education teacher at
        Springfield College in
        Massachusetts. Naismith created the game to keep his students from getting bored during the winter.</p>
    <p class="p2">Basketball is the only major sport that originated in the United States, although Naismith was born in
        Canada. It's one
        of the most popular and widely viewed sports in the world.</p>
